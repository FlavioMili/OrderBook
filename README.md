# OrderBook Simulation

A C++ implementation of a simple Order Book system designed to simulate market orders (buy and sell), process matching orders, and track the state of the book.

## Features

- Simulate random buy and sell orders.
- Efficient order processing based on price.
- Dynamic order book updates with matching of buy and sell orders.
- Command-line histogram visualization of the order book state.

## Performance with example
``` 
Number of orders to process: 1234567
Average time to process an order: 593.097 nanoseconds
Total time: 0.732217 seconds
```
